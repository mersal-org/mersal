Message Processing Pipeline
========================

..
   .. note::
      This page is a placeholder for pipeline documentation. It will be expanded in future updates.

   Overview
   --------

   The message processing pipeline in Mersal is a sequence of steps that process incoming and outgoing messages. The pipeline architecture provides a flexible and extensible way to handle message processing.

   Basic Pipeline Structure
   ----------------------

   The pipeline consists of two main parts:

   1. **Incoming Pipeline**: Processes messages received from a transport
      - Message deserialization
      - Handler activation
      - Message dispatching

   2. **Outgoing Pipeline**: Processes messages being sent to a transport
      - Header setting
      - Message serialization
      - Message transmission

   More details on the message processing pipeline will be added in future documentation updates.
